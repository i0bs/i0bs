## Work

I'm an UX/UI Engineer at [Shadowbin](https://shadowb.in), building the next cutting-edge file sharing service. With our core features, we plan to make encryption a new standard within the file sharing market of the software industry. We'll take care of the heavy lifting for you with features such as end-to-end encryption between parties, synchronised sharing, self-hosting, team management, and (of course) free-yet-anonymous analytics.

Let's [build the future together.](mailto:hello@shadowb.in) :)

## Experience

Officially speaking, I reserve my time as a backend engineer with a strong focus on API and Infrastructure Engineering. However, I am fully capable of also working with embedded systems, frontend development and cloud engineering. I'm an all-around "jack of all trades" and the typical full-stack developer that you might expect to hire as your solution to replacing an entire IT department.

I mainly work in Python, Rust, Go, PHP, Zig and TypeScript. I have over 10 years of software developer experience and always learning more.
Instead of providing a portfolio, here is an non-exhaustive list of projects and teams that I've been a part of:

- *Founder*, [*interactions.py*](https://github.com/interactions-py) - A feature complete client library for Discord's real-time Gateway and RESTful APIs.
- *OSS Developer*, [*EdgeDB*](https://github.com/edgedb) - A next-generation graph-relational database.
- *Backend Engineer*, [*digicale*](https://github.com/digicale) - A 3rd party service specialising in building custom solutions.
- *Lead Product Engineer*, [*modulus.gg*](https://github.com/modulusgg) - A social communications delivery provider for bot automation.
- *UX/UI Designer*, [*Shadowbin*](https://github.com/shdwbin) - An encrypted, privacy-focused file sharing service.
